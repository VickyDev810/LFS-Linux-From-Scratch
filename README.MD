Linux From Scratch (LFS) Project

This repository contains the source code and steps for building a custom Linux system from scratch. It follows the official Linux From Scratch (LFS) book and includes scripts, configuration files, and build instructions necessary to compile and assemble a basic Linux operating system.

The goal is to create a minimal, efficient, and fully customizable Linux environment tailored to your needs.

Key Features:
- Step-by-step guide for compiling the Linux kernel, essential utilities, and libraries.
- Customized configurations for a lightweight, secure, and modular system.
- Includes a variety of useful build scripts to automate the setup process.

For detailed instructions and the complete guide, refer to the [LFS book](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/).

This project is intended for educational purposes, hobbyists, and advanced users looking to gain deeper insights into the inner workings of Linux.
