## **🚀 Linux From Scratch (LFS) Project**  

This repository documents the process of **building a custom Linux system from scratch** using the **official Linux From Scratch (LFS) methodology**. It includes **scripts, configuration files, and step-by-step build instructions** necessary to compile and assemble a fully functional Linux operating system.  

### **🎯 Project Goals**
✅ Gain a **deep understanding of Linux internals**  
✅ Build a **lightweight, efficient, and modular Linux system**  
✅ Customize every aspect of the OS, from **kernel to package management**  
✅ Automate and document the **entire LFS build process**

## **📌 Features**
🔥 **Step-by-step guide** for compiling the Linux kernel, essential utilities, and libraries  
🔥 **Customized configurations** for a lightweight, secure, and optimized system  
🔥 **Automation scripts** to speed up repetitive tasks  
🔥 **Screenshots & logs** to track progress and document common challenges  
🔥 **Security & optimization tweaks** for better performance

## **🔧 Prerequisites**
Before starting this project, make sure you have:  
🔹 **A Linux-based host system** (I’m using Arch Linux 🏴)  
🔹 **At least 20GB of free disk space**  
🔹 **Minimum 4GB RAM** (8GB recommended for faster compilation)  
🔹 **Basic knowledge of Linux commands, shell scripting, and system administration**

## **📖 Official Reference**
This project follows the **[Linux From Scratch Book](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)** for building the system. For additional details, check the official documentation.

## **💡 Why Build Linux From Scratch?**
Building LFS is not just about installing Linux—it’s about **learning how Linux works from the inside out**. By manually compiling and configuring everything, you gain **full control over the system**, understand **how software interacts at the lowest levels**, and develop **advanced debugging skills**.

## **🤝 Contributing & Feedback**
This project is primarily for **learning and documentation**, but feel free to **open issues** or suggest improvements! If you’re also working on an LFS build, I’d love to hear about your experience.

## **📌 Next Steps**
📌 Complete core LFS installation ✅  
📌 Experiment with **Beyond LFS (BLFS)** (GUI, networking, package management)  
📌 Automate parts of LFS setup with **Bash/Ansible scripts**  
📌 Optimize system for **security and performance**
